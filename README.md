# Testing

Console Application: Takes in a string containg doubles seperated by operators (+, -, *, /, ^). 
You can include parentheses in the input but you can NOT put them right next to numbers, there must be a space. 
Does NOT support input of negative numbers. It can output negative numbers though. 3-12 =-9 for example. 
Spaces are filtered out.
